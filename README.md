# Animate-element
animate everything
In this project I wrote the animation code of an element in javascript

index.html=
 in this project I create 5 <div> tag in my (index) and inside of them i create <p> tag with "animate" class.
 and i import animate.css in my project that I downloaded from the "https://animate.style/" then link animate.css to my index.html.
  
script.js=
  in the script js we have two function 
   1.AllAnimate()
   2.SpecificAnimate()
  AllAnimate=
  this function for all element that we need to animate them and we give "animate" class in index.html then we can use it for animate
  in this method I create condition for my odd and even element to give them animation class Separate
  'you can change condition for example give all element same animation class or give index=1,index=5 same animation and another index give another animation Or similar    examples of the same '
  SpecificAnimate=
   this function for one element that we need to animate them and we give "animate" class in index.html then we can use it for animate
   i suggest AllAnimate function because this function is cleaner and can give animation to specific element with using index condition.
